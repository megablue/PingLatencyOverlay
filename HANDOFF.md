# Session handoff — PingLatencyOverlay

Next: `docs/features/README.md` — the feature map. Read only the page for
your area before the code.

**A snapshot, not a source of truth.** This file goes stale by design. If it
disagrees with the code, the code is right. `AGENTS.md` is the process doc,
`docs/features/` is the feature map and `docs/SPEC.md` is the behaviour spec.
This file is the volatile one — it exists so a new session knows *where things
stand*, not *how they work*.

As of `fa6261e` — 2026-10-06 (after the features-map migration).

## State

- Everything is pushed, the tree is clean, and nothing is in flight. Read
  `git log -1` for the tip and `git rev-list --count HEAD` for the commit count
  the version derives from — do not trust a number written here.
- Tests: 291 across the workspace. Last bundle:
  `PingLatencyOverlay_0.2.39_x64-setup.exe` (commit `7468388`); the next
  release build takes its version from the commit count.
- The features-map migration is complete: 13 pages under `docs/features/` with
  the README index, and `AGENTS.md` is process plus hard rules only.

## Open threads

- None. The smooth-rendering investigation (the newest segment appearing to
  skip instead of scrolling with the rest of the line) is closed: the line
  path had no regression, and the reveal hold plus the shifted time mapping
  replaced the pop with a tip that walks its segment.

## Known gaps (volatile; the durable traps live in the feature pages)

- **Multi-monitor is verified by synthetic monitor lists only** — one monitor
  on this machine, so the positioning has never been seen by eye.
- **Sticky mode's rarer paths were exercised by scripted repros**, not by eye:
  the FollowWindow z-order option, multi-window targets (focused match first,
  else topmost) and DPI changes while following. The main path was confirmed
  on real apps.
- **A theme file edited on disk is re-read only at the next launch.**
- **A release build logs nothing unless `PLO_LOG` is set** — say so when
  asking for a log.
- The About page's copyright line has not been eyeballed since 0.2.22.

## Local-only state (not on GitHub)

- `archive/egui-rewrite-*-2026-09-24` — local tags holding the abandoned work
  of that day; push them with `git push origin "refs/tags/archive/*"` if they
  must outlive this clone.
- **Every SHA before 2026-09-29 is dead** — the history was force-rewritten to
  drop an unwanted trailer; `git log` is the only truth.
- Session scratch lives under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp\opencode\` — the commit
  message file, capture sandboxes and repro scripts. Ephemeral by design.

## If testing themes on Windows

`HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Themes\Personalize\AppsUseLightTheme`
(1 = light, 0 = dark) is what the app follows; **restore it to 0 when done.**
